# IndieFab

**IndieFab** is an open-source initiative to decentralize electronics manufacturing by empowering small, local businesses to produce discrete components, sensors, and memory devices using low-cost, garage-scale microfabrication techniques.

## üí° Why IndieFab?
Modern supply chains are fragile, centralized, and dependent on foreign manufacturers for even the most basic components. Despite billions allocated through efforts like the CHIPS Act, there is no support for micro-scale, domestic production led by small businesses or individuals.
**IndieFab exists to change that.**
We believe that resistors, capacitors, thermistors, fuses, memory, displays, and even logic devices should be manufacturable in a garage, school lab, or small shop ‚Äî using affordable, well-documented tools and processes.

## üîß What We're Building
- **Resistor & Passive Component Fabs**  
  Screen printing + laser trimming of carbon-based resistors with competitive pricing and performance.
- **Memory Prototypes**  
  Printable ReRAM cells and ferroelectric memory using low-cost ceramics and deposition techniques.
- **Process Library**  
  Open fabrication workflows using UV lasers, stencils, photolithography, and accessible materials.
- **Open Toolchain**  
  Templates for part layout, testing rigs, automated trimming, labeling, and packaging.
- **Long-Term Goal:**  
  Development of domestic lithography and microfab tools capable of full CPU/GPU manufacturing.

## üåé Why It Matters
- **Right to Repair**: Local component availability means real hardware freedom  
- **Resilient Industry**: Disconnected from overseas disruptions  
- **Economic Empowerment**: Gives local makers a path into electronics manufacturing  
- **National Security**: Strengthens domestic supply chains at the grassroots level

## üì¶ Example Outputs
- 1 tile (5" x 5") can produce:
  - 3,000+ 0805 resistors  
  - 7,000+ 0402 resistors  
  - 14,000+ 0202 resistors  
At material costs under $5/tile.
